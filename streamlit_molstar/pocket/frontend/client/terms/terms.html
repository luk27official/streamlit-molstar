  <h2>ELIXIR CZ Terms of Use of the ELIXIR CZ Services</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      ELIXIR CZ requires attribution for any of its services or data that
      it is subsequently used in another product or service.
    </li>
    <li>
      The public databases of ELIXIR CZ are freely available by any
      individual and for any purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
      Software which can be run on the ELIXIR CZ web pages may be used by
      any individual for any purpose unless specific exceptions are
      stated. The only exceptions with respect to software will be the
      prohibition of downloading, redistributing or re-engineering the
      software, and these exceptions only apply if explicitly stated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Users of ELIXIR CZ services agree not to attempt to use any part of
      ELIXIR CZ computers, files or networks apart from through the
      service interfaces provided.
    </li>
    <li>
      If any single organisation (user) exploits ELIXIR CZ services to a
      level that prevents, or looks set to prevent, ELIXIR CZ providing
      services to others, ELIXIR CZ may discontinue service to that user.
      ELIXIR CZ will then contact the user to discuss their needs and how
      (and if) these can be met. Suggested solutions may include such
      heavy users licensing for their own in-house use third-party
      software used in ELIXIR CZ services (e.g. from biowisdom, QBioCom,
      Wash. University, U. of Virginia, NCBI). With permission from the
      user, ELIXIR CZ may divulge their identity to such
      third parties, and jointly propose possible solutions.
    </li>
    <li>
      ELIXIR CZ does not guarantee the accuracy of any data or databases
      nor the suitability of databases, software and services for any
      purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
      For planning and scientific review purposes, ELIXIR CZ will keep
      records of usage. ELIXIR CZ may make information about the total
      volume of usage of particular software or databases to third parties
      organisations who supply the software or databases. Logs of usage
      may also be maintained for the purposes of monitoring and improving
      services, and measuring the impact a particular service has on our
      resources. These logs will be kept in confidence and not made
      available for other purposes or to third parties. EMBL-EBI regards
      the nature of the work carried out by any individual user as
      confidential, and shall make every reasonable attempt to prevent
      breaches of that confidentiality (link to Privacy Statement).
    </li>
    <li>

      breach of the confidentiality of ELIXIR CZ site by third parties who
      by any means gain illegitimate access to information from ELIXIR CZ.
    </li>
    <li>
      ELIXIR CZ itself places no restrictions on the use or redistribution
      of the data available via its services. However, some of the
      original data may be subject to rights claimed by third parties,
      including but not limited to, patent, copyright, other intellectual
      property rights as well as biodiversity-related access and
      benefit-sharing rights. It is the responsibility of users of ELIXIR
      CZ services to ensure that their exploitation of the data does not
      infringe any of the rights of such third parties. ELIXIR CZ can
      neither comment on the validity of their claims nor grant
      unrestricted permission regarding the use of the data.
    </li>

      service and provide adequate warning of any changes or
      discontinuities. However, ELIXIR CZ accepts no responsibility for
      the consequences of any temporary or permanent discontinuity in
      service.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any feedback on services and software provided by ELIXIR CZ will be
      treated as non-confidential unless the individual or organisation
      providing the feedback states otherwise.
    </li>
    <li>
      ELIXIR CZ is not liable to you or third parties claiming through
      you, for any loss or damage.
    </li>
    <li>
      These Terms of Use reflect the enduring principles under which
      ELIXIR CZ services are offered. We will not, without good reason,
      alter them, and where alterations are inevitable, we will attempt to
      give reasonable notice of such alterations. However, we do reserve

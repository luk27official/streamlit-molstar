  <p>
    PrankWeb is a web-based application that allows to predict and visualize protein-ligand binding sites.
    Furthermore, it allows to compare the location of predicted pockets with highly conserved areas as well as actual ligand binding sites.
    All one needs to use PrankWeb is a device with a web-browser that supports WebGL.
  </p>

  <h2 id="specify-what-protein-to-analyze">
    Specify what structure to analyze
  </h2>
  <p>
    There are three options to obtain a structure:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      PrankWeb can download it automatically from PDB database provided the protein identification code.
    </li>
    <li>
      A structure file,
      <a href="http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">PDB</a>
      or mmCif, can be uploaded from user's computer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Provided Uniprot ID PrankWeb can download structure from
      <a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AlphaFold Protein Structure Database</a>.
      For this option the structure visualisation is colored using residue-level confidence scores.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conservation</h2>
  <p>
    Besides selecting what protein to analyze, one can also specify whether evolutionary conservation should be included in the prediction model by checking the <em>Use conservation</em> checkbox.
    Note that calculating conservation score can increase the time of analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    The new conservation pipeline operates as follows.
    First, polypeptide chain sequences are extracted from the input file using P2Rank.
    The phmmer tool from the <a href="http://hmmer.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">HMMER software package</a> is then used to identify and align similar sequences for each respective query; UniRef50 Release 2021 03 is used as the single target sequence database.
    Up to 1,000 sequences are then randomly selected from each MSA to form the respective sample MSAs; weights are assigned to the individual sequences constituting the sample MSAs using the Gerstein/Sonnhammer/Chothia algorithm implemented in the <em>esl-weigh</em> miniapp included with the HMMER software.
    Finally, per-column information content (i.e., conservation score) and gap character frequency values are calculated using the <em>esl-alistat</em> miniapp, taking the individual sequence weights into account; positions containing the gap character in more than 50% of sequences are masked to appear as possessing no conservation at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    The range of the conservation corresponds to the range of the per-residue of information content which is between 0 and ~ 4 ( = log<sub>2</sub>(20) ) with higher values corresponding to higher conservation.
  </p>

  <h2 id="visualization">Visualization</h2>
  <p>
    Once the protein visualization is loaded, three main panels appear: sequence visualization, structural visualization and the pocket panel.
  </p>
  <img src="./assets/images/help-00.png"
       style="width: 100%"
       class="img-responsive center-block"
    />
  <h3 id="structural-visualization-1">Structural visualization</h3>
  <p>
    The largest panel contains the three-dimensional visualization of the protein.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      By default, the protein surface is displayed, and individual pocket areas are highlighted with different colors.
      Ligands (if available) are displayed with yellow.
    </li>
    <li>
      The user may change the coloring of the protein in the tool box on the right side. 
    </li>
    <li>
      If a conservation score is available, the protein atoms may be colored with shades of gray according to the score of each residue.
      Darker color depicts higher score.
    </li>
    <li>
      If an AlphaFold score (pLDDT) is available, the protein atoms may be colored with the apropriate color according to the score of each residue.
      The colors are defined by <a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/">AlphaFold</a> (blue depicts more confidence).
    </li>
    <li>
      To switch between the views of the protein, use <b>Protein visualisation</b> and <b>Pockets visualisation</b> selections at top of the pocket panel on the right.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="controls">Controls</h4>
  <p>
    The molecule can be rotated by moving mouse while holding left mouse button.
    On a touch device, just slide your finger.
    To zoom in or out, use your mouse wheel button or use the pinch gesture on a touch display.
    In order to move the protein, hold the right mouse button.
    Lastly, for slabbing the protein, scroll the mouse wheel or use the three finger gesture.
  </p>
  <p>Using the buttons in the top-right corner, one can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reset the camera.</li>
    <li>Create a snapshot of current visualization.</li>
    <li>Toggle the advanced control panel.</li>
    <li>Toggle full-screen mode.</li>
    <li>
      Setup the scene such as the visualization background or the field of view.
    </li>
    <li>Toggle the selection mode.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The panel with advanced controls is toggled by default. It is located on the left side of the viewer. Using the buttons, the user is able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Work with the structure and download it.</li>
    <li>Toggle the state tree and thus toggle all of the available representations.</li>
    <li>Save the current plugin state.</li>
    <li>View the help panel.</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <h3 id="sequence-visualization-1">Sequence visualization</h3>
  <p>The panel above protein 3D visualization displays protein sequence.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All chains are concatenated and visualized at once.
    </li>
    <li>
      Colored rectangles depict areas with predicted pockets and real binding areas (if available).
    </li>
    <li>
      Real binding sites are residues within 4 &#8491; from any ligand atom.
    </li>
    <li>
      If available, conservation and AlphaFold scores are portrayed using a bar chart.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As one hovers over the sequence with mouse, the residues are highlighted in the 3D visualization.
    This feature allows to analyze the protein both from the structural and sequential point of view.
    By default, the sequence view is zoomed out so that the whole protein is displayed.
    You can use your mouse to zoom in, or zoom to the selected residue by clicking the responsible area.
  </p>

  <h2 id="pocket-panel">Pocket panel</h2>
  <p>
    The right panel contains several control buttons and a list of predicted pockets.
    Use the control buttons to download PrankWeb report, or switch between the structural views.
    In the pocket list, pocket name, rank, <a href="#probability-score">probability score</a>, size, average conservation score (if available) and average AlphaFold score (if available) is displayed for each pocket.
    Each pocket also contains several buttons related to visibility of the pockets in the visualizations.
    The user might show the dialog with additional information as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the visualised structure is predicted, then this panel also contains a warning and a toggle button.
    Using the button user can toggle between visualisation of a whole structure and confidently predicted regions (confidence score &gt; 70).
  </p>

  <h3 id="probability-score">Probability score calculation</h3>
  <p>
    The transformer that calculates probability scores from raw scores is calibrated for each individual model (Default, Default+Conservation, Alphafold, Alphafold+Conservation) on the calibration dataset (HOLO4K).
    The probability score <em>P(x)</em> for a given raw score <em>x</em> is calculated the following way: <em>P(x) = T<sub>x</sub> / (T<sub>x</sub> + F<sub>x</sub>)</em> where <em>T<sub>x</sub></em> is the number of true pockets with a raw score &leq;x and <em>F<sub>x</sub></em> is the number for false pockets with the score &geq;x (both refer to the predictions of a particular model on the calibration dataset).
